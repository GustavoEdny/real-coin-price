# Real Coin Price

#### A simple function that gets the real price of any coin given a fraction of that coin, and the purchased value.

### How to install

##### With NPM

```
 npm install @gustavoedny/real-coin-price
```
##### With NPM

```
 yarn add @gustavoedny/real-coin-price
```

### How to use

```
const realCoinPrice = require('@gustavoedny/real-coin-price')
// The result will be 100
const realPrice = realCoinPrice(0.5, 50)
```

Of course there is should be so much other solutions for this. However, I was planning about my finances, 
and I found a problem do discover the price I have purchased some Bitcoin and other Crypto Currencies.
So I started to think about how I could get the real price since I have the fraction, and the 
purchased value, then I started to code something.
